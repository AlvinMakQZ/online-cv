    assignments:
      - title: Product Recommendation Systems
        tagline: "This project involved building recommendation systems for Amazon products. A popularity-based model and a collaborative Filtering model were used and evaluated to recommend top-10 products for a user."

      - title: Sarcasm Detection using Natural Language Processing
        tagline: "The goal of this hands-on project is to analyse the headlines of the articles from news sources and detect whether they are sarcastic or not, using LSTM, Classification, GloVe, Word Embedding techniques."

      - title: Face Detection & Recognition using Computer Vision
        tagline: "The goal of this project is to build a face recognition system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces."

      - title: Implementing a Image classification neural network to classify Street House View Numbers
        tagline: "SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network."

      - title: Classifying silhouettes of vehicles in unsupervised learning
        tagline: "Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification."
        
      - title: Predicting the strength of high performance concrete
        tagline: "This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance."
        
      - title: Term Deposit Subscription Prediction
        tagline: "To help the marketing team identify potential customers to subscribe to a term deposit using Ensemble Techniques, Boosting, Random forest, Bagging."
